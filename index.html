  <h1>thatsNotYoChild.js Demo Page</h1>

  <p>A ridiculous script to solve the CSS parent/child opacity problem.</p>

<div class="parent" id="parent">

  <div class="child">
  </div>
  <p>The blue box and the text are child elements of the element that has a photo background. The child elements do not inerit the opacity setting on the parent. This is done using a jedi mind trick, aka "JavaScript".</p>
  
  <p>The rest of this is just filler text. Don't read this, you're just wasting your time. Are you serious? You're still reading? I'm not lying, this is just filler. I just need this to wrap below the box. That's all.</p>
